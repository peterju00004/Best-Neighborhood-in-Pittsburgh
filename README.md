CMPINF 0010 FINAL PROJECT REPOSITORY - By Bussin' (Canvas Group #24)

This project provides an insight to which neighborhood in Pittsbrugh is the best rated on a 3-dimensional environmental-and-health metric. Submetrics include pollution (PM 2.5), illegal dump sites, and hypertension and hyperlipidemia situations in each of the neighborhoods.
